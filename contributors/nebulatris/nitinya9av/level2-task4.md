# Cybersecurity: An Overview

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, interrupting normal business processes, or extorting money from users.


## Importance of Cybersecurity

With an increasing amount of data being stored and shared online, cybersecurity has become crucial. It's not just large corporations or governments that are at risk - individuals, small businesses, and non-profit organizations can also fall victim to cyberattacks.

## Types of Cyber Threats

1. **Malware**: Malicious software such as viruses, worms, and Trojans, which can damage a user's computer, server, or network.
2. **Phishing**: A method of tricking individuals into providing sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and credit card details.
3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: When attackers interrupt and breach communication between two parties to steal data.
4. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks**: These attacks flood systems, servers, or networks with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth, causing the system to become inaccessible to users.

## Cybersecurity Best Practices

- Regularly update and patch all systems and software.
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
- Enable multi-factor authentication where possible.
- Regularly backup important data and ensure it can be restored.
- Educate employees about cybersecurity risks and how to recognize potential threats.

Remember, cybersecurity is not a one-time solution but an ongoing process. It involves continually assessing and improving defenses to protect against evolving threats.
